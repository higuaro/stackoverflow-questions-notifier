# stackoverflow-questions-notifier
A Linux Mint Cinnamon Applet that checks stackoverflow (in a configured timeout) 
and popups a notification when a new question, tagged with one or several 
defined tags, is posted on the site

# about this

I'm a fan of [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), I like to help 
people around and to win some reputation points at the same time. I cannot
answer all the questions, in fact, I can only answer 
questions bounded by some tags, and those question usually 
are already answered whenever I check the site, so this applet is made with the
pourpose of showing one of those handy Linux Mint notifications every time a new
question (that has at least one of any interest tags) is posted in the site, so 
I won't (and of course you, if you add it) lose chance to answer some questions
