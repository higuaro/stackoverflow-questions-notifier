# about this

I'm a fan of [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), I like to help 
people around, to learn new stuff and to win some reputation points at the same time. 

I also spend a lot of time in my LinuxMint box, so I wrote this applet to
hunt for questions that are of interest without spending time refreshing the 
browser waiting for some of those questions to appear.
